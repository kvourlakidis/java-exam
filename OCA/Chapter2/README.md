# Object Orientation

## Key points

* Encapsulation helps hide implementation detail behind an interface (or API).
* Encapsulated code has 2 features:
    * Instance variables are protected (private modifier)
    * Getter and setter methods provide access to instance variables
* IS-A refers to inheritance or implementation
* IS-A is expressed with the keyword extends or implements
* HAS-A means an instance of class A has a reference to an instance of class B or another instance of class A.
